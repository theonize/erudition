The pursuit of truth in theology and information.


## Premise
Information is a meaningful ordering of things.
To be meaning-full means an imputation of information.
A circular build-up of meaning beginning with a random order is impossible because higher-level is required; i.e. a goal; i.e. the ordering of words within a sentence, sentences within, paragraphs, paragraphs within chapters, chapters within books, books within libraries, libraries within...
  We of can meaning from a still jumble infer words.  However, this is only the case when we can imply rules of a system (in this case, English.). Even so, the meaning of the preceding sentence can only be had with some assumption of word order.  Without the authors help it's impossible to assure the correct meaning unless the rules only allow one correct word order.  Either way meaning requires authority.

Information is only distinguishable from noise in that something has attributed meaning to the order of the stuff.
Attributing information, countering disintegration and blandness requires organizing energy into higher forms- this is information.

The fact that two independent, autonomous beings can communicate depends on that information - and the agreement on that fact that it is information.
Ingestion of information requires on an organon - a system which can make sense of information.

So, what do we make of these collections of scribblings, which carry meaning at various levels, but has to have an inhrerent basis (i.e. information) to be understood?


To computer nerds _zero_ is the first number, _one_ is the second, et cetera...
The number of atoms in the world exceeds the amount of information ever produced by mankind by nearly 6 orders of magnitude...
Explanations of the origin of biological life, or even spiritual life, means nothing because it does not explain the origin of the information necessary to form that life...


## Goals
This repository is intended to provide self-study material drawn from scholarly, factual information to help explore topics.
Additionally cultivating an understanding of information in a theological context.
It is hoped that these materials will facilitate discussions and explorations of information science and the ramifications of it.
