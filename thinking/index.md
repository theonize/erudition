# Thinking
...we all do it, we just don't always do it on purpose...


## Reasoning

Reasoning is the art of making _sure_ what you think.
i.e. being able to defend what you believe in a way that others can understand


## Critical Thinking

Making reasonable arguments that presuppose and counter others reasonable objections.
This is an important skill that involves learning and creating counter-arguments to your ideas.


### Induction

Inductive reasoning involves _inducing_ meaning into some material.
This is, in fact, the type of thinking that an author utilizes.
However, it is presumptive (and incorrect) for a reader to do this.
This is not the same as application; that is, personalizing an interpretation of some material.
Induction means giving a meaning that is not original to the material.


### Deduction

Deductive reasoning involves _deducing_ meaning **from** some material.
However, only a few meanings which we could deduce from some material are valid.
Discovering these valid deductions involves understanding the context of the material.
e.g. to understand a sentence we ought to read the sentences near it, then the surrounding chapter, and the whole book...
However, there are multiple contexts:
* what is the genre/topic of the material?
* what is the historical context?
* what is the cultural context?
" what is the authors frame and position?
